# Genome-wide association study(GWAS) using GEMMA

#GWAS is an statistical genetic approach to identified SNPs(marker in genome) associated with traits. Here, I am learning GWAS through repeating the analysis in: A new regulator of seed size control in Arabidopsis identified by a genome-wide association study. In this study, authors identified SNPs significantly associated to size of seed in 191 Arabidopsis inbred lines.

#Genotype imputation using beagle. A marker, genotyped in part of inbred lines, could not be genotyped in others  because of sequencing deepth and so on. Therefore, based on Linkage disequilibrium, imputation of the ungenotyped markers is necessary.
